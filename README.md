Voronoi-slicing countries by locations of astro institutions

Hack Day project for NAM 2014 meeting in Portsmouth, UK.

Two different implementations (both using d3) to Voronoi slice a geographic area. The two maps made are:

* United States, with locations representing astronomy degree-granting institutions. List of 155 institutions is from Dimitri Veras' [map](http://dimitriveras.com/mapUSChrome/). 
* United Kingdom, with lcoations representing astronomy clubs. List of 213 clubs is from http://www.astronomyclubs.co.uk/Clubs/Counties.aspx.

d3 implementations for this are adapted from Mike Bostock (@mbostock) and Jason Davies (@jasondavies).
